HTTP REQUEST STRUCTURE
GET / index.html? firstName=Yaakov HTTP/1.1
method--URI String--Query String-----HTTP version

Ajax: Asynchronous Javascript and XML
a. In traditional web flow the client requests for a page by clicking a button
b. the request is fullfilled by server and 99% of time same page is loaded again with 
    very little change.
c. point is for such a little change the complet page was reloaded
d. but with ajax only the small piece of data that's inserted into current page is sent by server
e. SYNCHRONOUS EXECUTION: only one instruction is been executed at a time. Another can only be executed if first
                          is done executing
f. ASYNCHROUNOUS EXECUTION: more than one instructions executed at a time.
g. how is an ajax request handled by js engine?
    as an ajax request is encountered the request is sent to the HTTP requestor 
    the address of the js function is recorded in order to return the response when the request has been processed
    and the rest of the js code is executed in order. the response from http requestor is not waited upon
    i.e the call back function is not waited upon 
    response handler handles the response from server




JSON
Javascript object notation
Rules: 
1. property names must be in double quotes and the string values too 
2. rest is like object literals
3. json is just a string whose syntax is based on object literals
4. for conversions
    a. from json string to js object
        var obj = json.parse(jsonString)
    b. from obj to string
        var str = json.stringify(jsobject)
