1. styling can also be done with in the html opening tag this is called inline styling
2. to link a css stylesheet to an html file we use link tage specify the rel and href attributes e.g. 
   <link rel = "stylesheet" href = "filename.css"
3.  to have a working knowledge of the cascading algorithm, you should understand these four concepts.
    And these are origin, or origin precedence, merge, as well as inheritance and specificity. 
        a. origin
        b. merge is when external css says somethings for the element and some other rules too are given about that element in the
           document itself in style tag both merge and apply to the element
        c. DOM tree i.e. inheritance all children, direct or indirect will inherit properties of the parent element
        d. specificity i.e. most specific selector combination wins
            i. to decide specificity which combination will win we have a rule
            ii. style=""  |     id     |     class    | no. of elements
            iii. higher the score that combination wins
            iv. note : if u want to use the particular style only mark it !important along with value
4. styling text points in order
    a. font family
    b. color
    c. font size
    d. text transform : capitalize or uppercase or lowercase
    e. font weight bold etc
    f. font style
    g. text align
   em and percentage 
   em is the relative size of the current text size
   percentage is the percentage of the current text size increase
   GO TO FILE BASIC HTML FOR EXAMPLE
5. absolute and relative postitioning
   relative positioning is when an element is made anchor and you can shift it from left and right or bottom or top
   for absolute positioning the parent element with whose respect u wanna move should be declared relative
   and then you can set the top bottom left and right
6. media queries are for perfect layout according to size of device
