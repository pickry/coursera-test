 <!--padding is for inner content 
margin is from outside
1. when i set the width of the box it is by default not taking the complete widht but the
   width of the content the border and padding counts are extra over the specified widht
2. to adjust this there is a property called box-sizing which when set to border box makes the entire widht of the box 
   along with border and padding equal to the specified width, the size of content is adjusted accordingly
3. box sizing cannot be inherited from parent as in if u specify it for body it won't work throughout the page
4. start selector: says select every element and apply the specified property to it (new by CSS3)
5. MARGINS : the side to side margins add up while the below and up margins collapse the bigger one is the final margin
6. overflow property: if i have a hieght or width in which my content doesn't fit the content will overflow out of the border and
   margins, to solve this i would specify overflow as auto which provides a scroll bar to scroll through my content
   i can also have hidden(clip), scroll(scrolling both axes) and visible(default)-->
